# library-js

<p>The purpose of this small project is to connect HTML/CSS/JS basic practices to demonstrate object usage/etc. </p>
<p>dynamically updating based on user's input and ultimately setting up more advanced js projects further down the line by practicing DOM manipulation a sticky subject no matter how much experience one haves. </p>
<p>Notice, I am not using any framework knowledge acquired (such as React, etc. we will see those later on) </p>
<p>This is because I feel that frameworks come and go, constantly rotating in popularity, but fundamentals always persist </p>
